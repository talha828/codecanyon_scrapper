Orders & Dispatch Management: Handling orders is as easy as pie with StackFood. You’ll get a complete overview of your order status from the Orders section of the Admin panel. On the other hand, the dispatch management section will help you to monitor your all ongoing orders.
Food Management: As an admin, you can control the whole Food section by managing categories and subcategories, attributes, addons, and more. Plus, you can add products to any restaurant. And the Restaurant panel also will get a food management feature.
Order Scheduling: You can schedule orders within a set timeframe (each slot for 30 minutes) using Stackfood. While you’re having your breakfast, you can order your lunch and dinner with StackFood.
Deliveryman Management: You can add deliverymen as many as you want and manage them effectively in the admin panel. Hiring a deliveryman is possible in two ways: freelance or salary-based. For deliveryman, you’ll get an app by which you can operate your delivery system quite simply. Last but not least, using the StackFood admin panel, can directly assign (manually) an available delivery man in order.
Business Promotion: With StackFood, you can easily promote your business. The Promotions section in the admin panel will allow you to do it. Using campaigns, banners, coupons, and push notifications you can take your marketing to a whole new level.
Customer Management: This admin panel section comprises many things related to customers. From viewing customer lists, wallets, loyalty points, and subscribed emails to customer live chat; all are under one roof! Manage your customers effectively and GROW!
Direct Chat with Admin: Customers can directly chat with Admin for any issues or queries. Most of the online ordering and delivery systems don’t have this feature but StackFood provides this for better customer engagement.
Employee Management: The more your business grows, the more people you need to handle all things! That’s why StackFood comes with an Employee management section for you! You can add employees, and assign them particular roles to manage your business smoothly.
Analyze Report and Statistics: StackFood’s Report management section of the admin panel helps you to get the day-wise and food-wise reports. As a result, taking the required steps on anything that is not doing good, will be easier for you.
100% Responsive & Feature-packed App (Android & iOS): You will get StackFood mobile app source code with this bundle. We developed this by flutter so the app can be usable on both android and iOS.
Built-in POS System: To execute online payments, POS service is now a must. And each restaurant is likely to pay extra for this. But with StackFood, you’ll be getting this service totally FREE of cost as it’s included in the bundle. Having this service in your system, restaurant owners can manage walk-in customer’s orders easily.
Integrated All the Popular Payment Gateways: All the payment gateways have been integrated with the system to manage the payment procedure from anywhere in the world.
Outstanding System Settings: There are two different themes have been added for you. You can handle the app and landing page settings from the admin panel. A built-in gallery is also available and ReCaptcha is for security purposes.
Hassle-free Transaction Management: You can easily collect cash from restaurants and delivery from the admin panel’s transaction management system. Not only just this, restaurant withdraws, and deliveryman payments are also manageable through the admin panel.
Dark Mode
Nowadays, Dark mode is everywhere and has become a mandatory feature in the modern world. Likewise, users of StackFood can use both dark & light modes based on their preferences, as the entire system supports both visual modes.
Password Recovery System
Forgetting passwords are very common for everyone. That’s why recovering the forgotten password is a must! StackFood users can easily recover their login password using the proper recovery system.
Restaurant and Deliveryman Self-Registration
Seeing the benefits and facilities of StackFood, anyone wishes to be a part of your platform. That’s why we have the self-registration feature so that anyone can quickly register as a Restaurant or Deliveryman from the admin landing page, web & customer app.
User Account Delete
Change of mind is one of the most common natures of human beings. Keeping that in our concern, we have the “user account delete” feature. If any users want, they can completely delete their account from StackFood anytime.
Customer Cart
If anyone has multiple foods in mind to buy, they can keep adding their desired food to the Cart and keep browsing more options. Finally, he can see a clear overview of his all orders and quickly complete the checkout process from the cart.
Wishlist
Wishlist is another feature that helps customers a lot. They can save their favorite food for future purchases in the wishlist section and quickly buy them anytime from the list.
Ratings & Reviews
Customers can give ratings and reviews to both restaurants and deliverymen. It creates a transparent shopping experience for all customers.
User Apps & Web App
In the smartphone era, everything you can imagine has an app for it. StackFood also has Flutter-based apps for its users. This includes the Restaurant app, Deliveryman App, and Customer App.

Ordering Process with StackFood In A Nutshell: As Simple As It Could Be
Ordering and delivering with StackFood is simpler than ever. Below is the step-by-step process of ordering and delivery in a nutshell. If anything seems confusing to you, feel free to contact our support team. They’re always ready to help!
The first step is for the customer to place an order with the restaurant. Remember, customers cannot order from multiple restaurants at once.
The deliveryman will be notified about the order in the Order request section of the Deliveryman app and will accept it so that the order can be delivered.
The restaurant owner gets the order in the dashboard when the delivery boy confirms the order (if delivery confirmation is delivery man) and starts processing the order and hands it over to the delivery boy when the order is ready to deliver.
Digitally paid orders will go directly to the confirmed status and will appear on the restaurant’s dashboard without the delivery boy’s confirmation.
It is not necessary to get the delivery men’s confirmation if the store’s confirmation model is enabled, but after the restaurant’s confirmation, the delivery men will receive the order for acceptance.
Upon accepting the order (if COD), the Delivery Guy confirms it, picks it up, and delivers it to the customer.
For orders picked up at the restaurant, all steps will be managed by the restaurant.
When a scheduled order is placed, all operations will begin 15 minutes before the expected delivery time.
All being mentioned, what do you think, is StackFood worth the money that you spend? Well, we would like to say, if it was not a “Value for Money’’ then within this short period of time we couldn’t make this number of sales.

Don’t Just Go for Words, Go for Credibility
Instead of going with our words, see our client’s valuable feedback ( Codecanyon ) on StackFood! They’re the people behind our inspiration to do good work. 
We hope you’re clear about what you’ll be getting with StackFood
